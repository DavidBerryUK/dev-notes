# .Net Core
.NET (previously named .NET Core) is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. It is a cross-platform[ successor to .NET Framework.

To run on non-windows platforms not all framework functions are available, but these tend to be mostly frontend features such as desktop forms.

Languages such as C#, Visual Basic and F# compile down to IL (Intermediate Language) which is compiled again by a JIT (Just in time) compiler at runtime to machine code which is compatable on the current platform. This step allows the same application to run on multiple different platforms.

## Features
The core of .Net contains many features, but the power is in using available libraries from Microsoft and others that extend functionality. Examples are Entity Framework, Windows Forms, ASP.Net and Windows Presentation Foundation Framework.
