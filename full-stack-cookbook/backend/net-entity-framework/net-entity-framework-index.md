# .Net Entity Framework Foundation

Entity Framework Core is a modern object-database mapper for .NET. It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, updates, and schema migrations. EF Core works with many databases, including SQL Database (on-premises and Azure), SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Azure Cosmos DB.

The framework takes away the complexity of storing data on a server, and provides consistancy of interacting with databases using .Net syntax.

Databases are queries using [linq](..\linq\ling-index.md) (Language Integrated Query) framework.
